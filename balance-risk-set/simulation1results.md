## Simulation Results Recap

### Summary
- **Valid Simulations:** 1000 / 1000
- **True Treatment Effect:** 2
- **Bias:** -1.7678
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 1.7928
- **Coverage (95% CI):** 0

### Understanding Each Metric

#### 1. Valid Simulations: 1000 / 1000
**What it means:** Every single one of the 1,000 simulations ran without errors or missing data.
**Why it matters:** This ensures that the results are based on complete data, without disruptions.

#### 2. True Treatment Effect: 2
**What it means:** The actual treatment effect in the simulated data is set to 2. This serves as a benchmark for evaluating estimates.
**Context:** In simulations, the true treatment effect is predefined, so the goal is to assess how well the estimation method recovers it.

#### 3. Bias: -1.7678
**Definition:** Bias is the average difference between estimated treatment effects and the true effect.

\[ \text{Bias} = \text{Mean(Estimated Treatment Effects)} - \text{True Treatment Effect} \]

**Interpretation:** The estimates are, on average, 1.7678 units lower than the actual effect of 2.

**Percentage Bias:**
\[ \left( \frac{-1.7678}{2} \right) \times 100 \approx -88.39\% \]

**Implication:** The estimation method significantly underestimates the treatment effect.

#### 4. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 1.7928
**Definition:** RMSE combines bias and variance to measure overall estimation error.

\[ \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{ \text{Mean}((\text{Estimated Treatment Effects} - \text{True Treatment Effect})^2) } \]

**Interpretation:** On average, the estimated effects deviate from the true effect by about 1.7928 units.

**Relation to Bias:** Since the bias (-1.7678) is nearly equal to the RMSE, most of the error comes from systematic underestimation rather than random variation.

**Implication:** Simply increasing the sample size won’t fix the issue unless the bias itself is addressed.

#### 5. Coverage (95% CI): 0
**Definition:** Coverage probability measures how often the 95% confidence interval (CI) includes the true treatment effect.

\[ \text{Coverage Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of CIs containing the true effect}}{\text{Total number of simulations}} \]

**Interpretation:** None of the 1,000 confidence intervals included the true treatment effect.

**Ideal Case:** If the method was correctly specified, about 95% of the CIs should have covered the true effect.

**Implication:** The confidence intervals are missing the true effect entirely, suggesting major issues with how they are constructed.

## Key Takeaways

### 1. The Estimation Method Severely Underestimates the Treatment Effect
- The estimated effect is about **0.2322** instead of **2**.
- Possible causes:
  - **Imperfect Matching:** The method may not be balancing covariates well.
  - **Methodological Limitations:** The Balanced Risk Set Matching (BRSM) approach might not work well in this context.
  - **Outcome Model Issues:** The statistical model used after matching might be misspecified.
  - **Assumption Violations:** The method may rely on assumptions (e.g., no unmeasured confounding) that don’t hold in this setup.

### 2. RMSE is High Due to Bias
- Since RMSE (1.7928) is almost entirely due to bias, fixing random errors won’t help much.
- Addressing bias should be the main priority.

### 3. Confidence Intervals are Completely Off
- None of the confidence intervals contain the true treatment effect.
- Possible reasons:
  - The CIs might be **too narrow**, underestimating uncertainty.
  - **Bias is shifting estimates away** from the true effect, making CIs miss it entirely.
  - **Issues with bootstrap methods** (if used) could lead to incorrect intervals.

### 4. Potential Problems with the Simulation Design
- The original study’s simulation setup might not be well-suited for BRSM.
- Some factors that could be causing problems:
  - **High Dimensionality:** Too many covariates relative to sample size may affect matching quality.
  - **Extreme Propensity Scores:** If scores are near 0 or 1, good matches become rare.
  - **Time-Dependent Confounding:** If not properly accounted for, this can bias results.

### 5. Possible Implementation Issues
- Even if the setup follows the paper’s description, subtle differences might exist:
  - **Coding Errors:** Bugs in the implementation could distort results.
  - **Parameter Choices:** The settings used for matching (e.g., calipers, matching ratio) might differ from the intended approach.

## Next Steps
- **Check the implementation carefully** to rule out coding errors.
- **Reassess matching quality** to see if the method effectively balances covariates.
- **Compare with the original study**—do their reported results show similar issues?
- **Explore alternative estimation methods** if BRSM struggles under these conditions.

Addressing these points should help identify why the method is underperforming and how to improve it.
